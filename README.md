# News App

Here is my simple full stack news app, as per your requirements.

To run the app navigate to the backend folder and enter `npm run start`. Then navigate to the frontend folder and enter `npm run start`. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

I have included the .env files for convenience, typically I would never include environment files in a commit.

Improvements:
- My frontend design is not amazingly beautiful, but I think it is intuitive enough to serve its purpose. I would like to add some more css to ensure that it displays better on mobile devices and various screen sizes.
- I think adding an endless scroll or pagination function would be great and massively improve the functionality of the app.
- There are several TODO's scattered throughout the code to give you an idea of what I would do if I was building a larger and more complex system.
- Sometimes the data that is comes from News API is '[removed]' or the images don't render properly. I would add a fix for this.

## Tests
To run the tests navigate to the backend folder and enter `npm run test`.
